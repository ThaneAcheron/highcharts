- Added [pie.startAngle](http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/#plotOptions.pie.startAngle) option.
- Added a delay before hiding exporting menu to prevent the menu from hiding in IE when hovering over neighbour elements and button title. [Issue #1357](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1357).
- Implemented warning on unsorted data for line charts and stock charts. [Issue #725](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/725). Also throw a Highcharts error on unsorted column data, because the column distance and width logic relies on sorted data. Related to #987.
- Added line.step options: "left", "center", "right". Fixed issue with step in area ranges. [Issue #1330](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1330).
- Added a global lookup array, Highcharts.charts, holding all available chart instances in the page. This prevents issues with writing multiple charts to the same div.
- Implemented better animation for donuts. [Issue #779](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/779).
- Reorganized event assignment so that devices with touch support not only observe the touch events, but also the corresponding mouse events. This prepares for the new generation of browsers with both mouse and touch support. [Issue #1305](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1305).
- Prevented getTimeTicks from creating corrupted array. Related to #1301.
- Improved rendering speed of data labels by not adding a rectangle for labels without border or background.
- Better detection for repeating gradients. Instead for checking for the same object, the actual gradient definition is now used as the key. [Issue #1282](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1282).
