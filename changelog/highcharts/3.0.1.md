- Added new option, [tooltip.followTouchMove](http://api.highcharts.com#tooltip.followTouchMove). When this is true, the tooltip can be moved by dragging a single finger across the chart, like in Highcharts 2. When it is false, dragging a single finger is ignored by the chart, and causes the whole page to scroll. This applies only when zooming is not enabled. [Issue #1644](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1644). [Issue #1662](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1662).
- Added internationalization for the Print chart text. [Issue #1656](https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/issues/1656).
